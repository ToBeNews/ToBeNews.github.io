          <p>Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein says that unvaccinated people are worse than Watergate, and they might possibly be worse than German chancellor Adolf Hitler.</p>
          <p>Recently former Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein dropped a massive reality check on the world, like he has never done before.</p>
          <p>Carl Bernstein has for the 600th time said that doing something he doesn't like is 'worse than Watergate', which for those who live under a rock or were born after the 1980s was a scandal involving former president Nixon and the DNC.</p>
          <p>It is rare to hear such warning from one of the most credible and decorated journalists of the past century.</p>

          <p>After winning Tamyra made the fatal mistake of thanking her nation and God, which means that she is a terrorist.</p>
          <p>The U.S. State Department when asked about this terrorism they agreed and condemned her actions.</p>
